Pivot element, partitioning, and then recursion

# Quick sort (arr, low, high)

# The base case of course is, low > high


8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6, 4, 5
# Choose a random pivot 
# All the elements to the left of the pivot should be smaller
# All the elements to the right of the pivot should be larger
# Also called inplace change 

Time complexity: On Average: O(n* log2n), worst O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(log2n), worst O(n)
