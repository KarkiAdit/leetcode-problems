Time complexity for recursion is unit of time taken to reach the base case.
Space complexity of recursion is the max depth of stack space used to solve the problem.

// For factorial
O(n) is the space and time complexity

// For fibonacci
Time: O(2^(n/2)), O(2^n)
Spaace: O(n)

// Binary search
Time: log2(n)
Space: log2(n)


// In order binary tree traversal
Time: O(n)
Space: Maximum depth of the tree
